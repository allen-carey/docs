## Introduction
    
Our engine for Mobile Tests uses Appium to locate and interact with elements in native and hybrid mobile applications.
    
Appium does not provide direct `Scroll` or `Swipe` actions.
    
However, we can achieve the same effect with a `Flick` action or a `Move` action.
    
We simply need to flick or move in the opposite direction of the desired scroll or swipe.
    
## Options
    
### 1. Using the `Flick` action
    
The `Flick` action requires **3 parameters**:
    
- **Locator Type**
- **Locator**
- **Offset to flick by**

The value for the `Offset to flick by` is comprised of an **X offset** and a **Y offset**, separated by a comma.
    
The offset is equivalent to the scrolling distance in this case.
    
As you can see, we need an element in order to flick.
    
The `Flick` action does not work with all elements, and there is no attribute to indicate if an element is suitable or not.
    
If an element is not suitable for the `Flick` action, performing that action on that element will not result in a scroll on that page.
    
You will not see any errors in the logs in that case; you will just notice that it has no effect.
    
This is because the element was located and the action was performed, but Appium does not throw any errors if the `Flick` action did not result in a scroll.
    
<Tip> Try performing the `Flick` action with different elements until you find one that works. It's a trial and error process. </Tip>
    
 
<Note> For some applications, you might get an error that the `Flick` action is not supported. This is because the default versions of Appium used by BrowserStack and Sauce Labs might not support the `Flick` action for some applications. In this case, you can try changing the `Appium Version` from the `Settings` section of that test suite. </Note>
    
    
### 2. Using the `Move` action
    
The `Move` action requires **3 parameters**:
    
- **Locator Type**
- **Locator**
- **Destination**

The value for the `Destination` is comprised of an **X coordinate** and a **Y coordinate**, separated by a comma.
    
As you can see, we need an element in order to move.
    
The `Move` action does not work with all elements, and there is no attribute to indicate if an element is suitable or not.
    
If an element is not suitable for the `Move` action, performing that action on that element will not result in a scroll on that page.
    
You will not see any errors in the logs in that case; you will just notice that it has no effect.
    
This is because the element was located and the action was performed, but Appium does not throw any errors if the `Move` action did not result in a scroll.
    
<Tip> Try performing the `Move` action with different elements until you find one that works. It's a trial and error process. </Tip>
    
    
## Scroll Types
    
### 1. Scroll Down
    
To scroll down, we must flick up or move up.
    
- **Using the `Flick` action:**  
  Add a **negative value** for the Y offset:  
  `0, -500`
    
- **Using the `Move` action:**  
  Add a **small non-negative value** for the Y coordinate:  
  `0, 0`
    
    
### 2. Scroll Up
    
To scroll up, we must flick down or move down.
    
- **Using the `Flick` action:**  
  Add a **positive value** for the Y offset:  
  `0, 500`
    
- **Using the `Move` action:**  
  Add a **large non-negative value** for the Y coordinate:  
  `0, 500`
    
    
### 3. Scroll Left
    
To scroll left, we must flick right or move right.
    
- **Using the `Flick` action:**  
  Add a **positive value** for the X offset:  
  `500, 0`
    
- **Using the `Move` action:**  
  Add a **large non-negative value** for the X coordinate:  
  `500, 0`
    
    
### 4. Scroll Right
    
To scroll right, we must flick left or move left.
    
- **Using the `Flick` action:**  
  Add a **negative value** for the X offset:  
  `-500, 0`
    
- **Using the `Move` action:**  
  Add a **small non-negative value** for the X coordinate:  
  `0, 0`
