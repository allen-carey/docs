## Introduction
    
We need assertions to know if our test execution was successful or not. If we do not add assertions in our test cases, the values for `Passed` and `Failed` will be zero. A test case can have more than one assertion.
    
## Solution
    
Assertions can be added by using the `Add Assertion` action. You can choose from the following types of assertions:
    
| **Assertion Type**                   | **Description**                                                                       |
|--------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Element Is Present**               | Checks if an element is present                                                       |
| **Element Is Not Present**           | Checks if an element is not present                                                   |
| **Element Matches Value**            | Checks if the text from an element matches a certain value                           |
| **Element Does Not Match Value**     | Checks if the text from an element does not match a certain value                    |
| **Element Contains Value**           | Checks if the text from an element contains a certain value                          |
| **Element Does Not Contain Value**   | Checks if the text from an element does not contain a certain value                  |
| **Element Contains Attribute**       | Checks if an element contains a certain attribute                                    |
| **Element Does Not Contain Attribute** | Checks if an element does not contain a certain attribute                          |
| **Variable Assertion**               | Provides multiple ways to check a variable                                           |
| **Page Source Contains Value**       | Checks if the Page Source contains a certain value                                   |
| **Page Source Does Not Contain Value** | Checks if the Page Source does not contain a certain value                         |
