## Introduction
    
In some scenarios, your test might need to perform complex gestures.
    
For example, pinching and zooming on a map.
    
You can combine multiple `Touch Actions` into a `Sequence`
    
Additionally, you can combine multiple `Sequences` into a `Multi Touch Actions Sequence`.
    
## Actions
    
### 1. Set Touch Action
    
The `Set Touch Action` allows you to define a **Touch Action**:
    
- **Tap and Hold**
- **Move**
- **Release**

**Names** must be provided for each `Touch Action`.
    
These names will be used when executing the `Touch Actions` or when combining them into a `Sequence`.
    
<Note> Adding a `Set Touch Action` step will **not** execute that `Touch Action` it will only define it. </Note>
    
### 2. Execute Touch Actions Sequence
    
After defining the `Touch Actions` with `Set Touch Action` steps, you can execute them with an `Execute Touch Actions Sequence` step.
    
The **names** of the defined `Touch Actions` must be provided, separated by `+` signs.

### 3. Set Touch Actions Sequence
    
This action can be used if you want to store multiple `Touch Actions` in a `Sequence`.
    
<Note> Adding a `Set Touch Actions Sequence` step will **not** execute the `Sequence`; it will only define it. </Note>

**Names** must be provided for each `Sequence`.
    
These names will be used when executing the `Sequences`.
    
    
### 4. Execute Multi Touch Actions Sequence
    
This action can be used to execute multiple `Sequences` at the same time.
    
A good example is when you want to pinch and zoom on a map.
    
Both fingers would perform separate `Sequences` simultaneously.

The **names** of the defined `Sequences` must be provided, separated by `+` signs.


> To understand a complex gesture, it's best to first break down that gesture into `Sequences`.
> 
> Then, break down those `Sequences` into `Touch Actions`.
> 
> For example, pinching and zooming on a map is a gesture.
> 
> That gesture is made up of 2 `Sequences`.
> 
> Each finger will perform a separate `Sequence` simultaneously.
> 
> Each `Sequence` is defined by 3 `Touch Actions` (`Tap`, `Move`, `Release`), executed one after another.
