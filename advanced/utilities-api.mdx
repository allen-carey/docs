## Introduction

We provide an API endpoint called `Utilities` where you can send API requests during your tests in order to process data.

<Note> It's easier to use the standard <a class="endtest_link" href="/advanced/utilities/">Utilities</a>, which is an option available in the `Miscellaneous` action, instead of the Utilities API. </Note>

## Steps

1. Add a `Send API Request` step in your test.
2. Select the `GET` option from the list of request types.
3. Add the following URL in the `Enter request URL` input: `https://app.endtest.io/utilities`
4. In the `Params` section, add the `action` that you need together with the rest of Quary Params.
5. The `action` and the rest of the Query Params need to be added in the standard key-value format.
6. You can also add Endtest variables in the `Params` section, simply typing `$` in one of the inputs will show you a dropdown with all the available Endtest variables.
7. You can choose to save the response of that API request into a new Endtest variable.
8. Go to the `Response` section, in the `Body` subsection.
9. Choose the `Store in variable` option from the `Action` dropdown from the the `Body` subsection.
10. Add the name of the variable that will contain the body of the response.

## Actions

You can choose from different actions:

### 1. Extract Text After Pattern

The `extractTextAfterPattern` action can be used to extract a substring from a string, by providing another substring as a pattern.

**Query Params that you need to add in the `Send API Request` modal:**

| Key     | Value                                           |
|---------|-------------------------------------------------|
| action  | extractTextAfterPattern                         |
| text    | the full text or the name of the variable       |
| pattern | the pattern of text or the name of the variable |

For example, let's say you have the following text:

```
Your validation code is 1234
```

You can extract the `1234` portion of that text by providing the following pattern:

```
Your validation code is
```

That will extract the following substring:

```
1234
```

### 2. Extract Text Before Pattern

The `extractTextBeforePattern` action can be used to extract a substring from a string, by providing another substring as a pattern.

Query Params that you need to add in the `Send API Request` modal:

| Key     | Value                                           |
|---------|-------------------------------------------------|
| action  | extractTextBeforePattern                        |
| text    | the full text or the name of the variable       |
| pattern | the pattern of text or the name of the variable |

For example, let's say you have the following text:

```
1234 is your validation code
```

You can extract the `1234` portion of that text by providing the following pattern:

```
is your validation code
```

That will extract the following substring:

```
1234
```

### 3. Extract Numbers From Text

The `extractNumbersFromText` action can used to extract all the numbers from a string.

Query Params that you need to add in the `Send API Request` modal:

| Key     | Value                                           |
|---------|-------------------------------------------------|
| action  | extractNumbersFromText                          |
| text    | the full text or the name of the variable       |


For example, let's say you have the following text:

```
Your validation code is 1234. Do not share it with anyone else.
```

You can extract the `1234` portion of that text because it's entirely made up of numbers.


### 4. Extract Value From JSON

The `extractValueFromJSON` action can used to get a value from a JSON object.

Query Params that you need to add in the `Send API Request` modal:

| Key     | Value                                           |
|---------|-------------------------------------------------|
| action  | extractValueFromJSON                            |
| json    | the JSON object                                 |
| name    | the name for which you will get the value       |

For example, if you have the following JSON object:

```javascript
{"firstName":"John", "lastName":"Doe"}
```

This is how the `Send API Request` modal would look like if you want to extract the `firstName` value:

<img src="https://app.endtest.io/images/extractValueFromJSON.png" alt="endtest utilities extract json" height="450"/>

<Tip> Don't forget, you can also use Endtest variables in the `Send API Request` modal. </Tip>

### 5. Extract Item From Array

The `extractItemFromArray` action can used to get an item from an array.

Query Params that you need to add in the `Send API Request` modal:

| Key     | Value                                           |
|---------|-------------------------------------------------|
| action  | extractItemFromArray                            |
| array   | the array from which you will extract the items |
| index   | the location of the item from the array (the first array index is 0) |

For example, if you have the following array:

```javascript
["apple", "orange", "tomato"]
```

This is how the `Send API Request` modal would look like if you want to extract the second item:

<img src="https://app.endtest.io/images/extractItemFromArray.png" alt="endtest utilities extract item array" height="450"/>

Since you can use Endtest variables in the  `Params`, `Authorization` and `Headers` sections and you can also store the responses in Endtest variables, you can chain together multiple `Send API Request` steps which can use the `extractItemFromArray` and `extractValueFromJSON` actions to extract values from complex JSON objects.

In each `Send API Request`step, go to the `Body` section from the `Response` tab and select the option to store the value inside an Endtest variable, which will be used in the next step.


For example, you might have a complex JSON object like this:

```javascript
{
"employees":[
    {"firstName":"John", "lastName":"Doe"},
    {"firstName":"Anna", "lastName":"Smith"},
    {"firstName":"Peter", "lastName":"Jones"}
]
}
```
If you want to extract the second `firstName` value from that JSON object, you have to chain together 3 `Send API Request` steps:  

Start by using the `extractValueFromJSON` action to get the value for the `employees` item:

```javascript
[
    {"firstName":"John", "lastName":"Doe"},
    {"firstName":"Anna", "lastName":"Smith"},
    {"firstName":"Peter", "lastName":"Jones"}
]
```

That value will be an array and you can use the `extractItemFromArray` to get the second item from that array.

```javascript
{"firstName":"Anna", "lastName":"Smith"}
```

That item will be a JSON object and you can once again use the `extractValueFromJSON` action to get the value for the `firstName`.


### 6. Extract Last Item From Array

The `extractLastItemFromArray` action can used to get the last item from an array.

Query Params that you need to add in the `Send API Request` modal:

| Key     | Value                                           |
|---------|-------------------------------------------------|
| action  | extractLastItemFromArray                        |
| array   | the array from which you will extract the item  |

For example, if you have the following array:

```javascript
["apple", "orange", "tomato"]
```

This is how the `Send API Request` modal would look like if you want to extract the last item:

<img src="https://app.endtest.io/images/extractLastItemFromArray.png" alt="endtest utilities extract last item array" height="450"/>

### 7. Get Text Length

The `getTextLength` action can used to get the character count of a text.

Query Params that you need to add in the `Send API Request` modal:

| Key     | Value                                           |
|---------|-------------------------------------------------|
| action  | getTextLength                                   |
| text    | the full text or the name of the variable       |


### 8. Store Item in Vault

In some scenarios, you might need to manage values across different test suites.

These use cases can usually be handled by using <a class="endtest_link" href="/advanced/how-to-use-variables/">Variables</a> and <a class="endtest_link" href="/advanced/importing-test-cases/">Import Test Case</a> actions.

But there are other scenarios where one test suite might update a value which is used by other test suites.

You can use the `Endtest Vault` to store and fetch global values, which can be accessed from all your test suites.

These global values are called `items`.

The `storeItemInVault` action can be used to store an item.

The `items` stored in the `Endtest Vault` can only be accessed by you and your Team.

Query Params that you need to add in the `Send API Request` modal:

| Key      | Value                                           |
|----------|-------------------------------------------------|
| action   | storeItemInVault                                |
| itemName | the name of the item                            |
| itemValue| the value of the item                           |
| appId    | the appId for your Endtest account                      |
| appCode  | the appCode for your Endtest account                    |

This is how the `Send API Request` modal would look like:

<img src="https://app.endtest.io/images/endtest_store_item_in_vault_1.png" alt="endtest store item vault" height="450"/>

You can also use <a class="endtest_link" href="/advanced/how-to-use-variables/">Variables</a>:

<img src="https://app.endtest.io/images/endtest_store_item_in_vault_2.png" alt="endtest store item vault" height="450"/>

For example, let's say you have the following text:

```
Hello world!
```

You can extract the `Hello` portion of that text by providing the following `count`:

```
5
```

That will extract the following substring:

```
Hello
```

### 22. Generate File

The `generateFile` action can be used to generate a file, by providing the content and the name.

Query Params that you need to add in the `Send API Request` modal:

| Key     | Value                                           |
|---------|-------------------------------------------------|
| action  | generateFile                        |
| fileName    | the name of the file (needs to include the extension)      |
| content | the content that will be placed inside the file |

For example, let's say you have the following `content`:

```
Hello
```

And you want to save it in a file called `sample.txt`:


That will generate a text file with the name `sample.txt` that contains the text `Hello`.

The file will be automatically stored on our side and the Response Body from that request will contain the online link to that file.

### 23. Extract Latest SMS

The `extractLatestSMS` action can be used to fetch the latest SMS from a Phone Number assigned to your team.

<Note> This functionality requires real phone numbers to be assigned to your team. <br /> <br /> We provide real phone numbers for our users. You don't have to use any external service. <br /> <br /> If there are no real phone numbers assigned to your team, you can request one by contacting our Support Team. <br /> <br /> This functionality is not related in any way to the phone number that you have provide for the Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) for your Endtest account. </Note>

Query Params that you need to add in the `Send API Request` modal:

| Key      | Value                                           |
|----------|-------------------------------------------------|
| action   | extractLatestSMS                                |
| number  | the phone number                 |
| appId    | the appId for your Endtest account                      |
| appCode  | the appCode for your Endtest account                    |
| markAsRead  | true or false                   |
| delete  | true or false                    |

This is how the `Send API Request` modal would look like:

<img src="https://app.endtest.io/images/endtest_documentation_utilities_sms.png" alt="endtest extract latest sms utilities" height="450"/>

If everything is correct, the response will contain this JSON:

```javascript
{
    "from_number": "The phone number that sent the SMS message",
    "to_number": "The phone number that received the SMS message",
    "body": "The body of the SMS message",
    "timestamp": "The UTC timestamp, e.g., 2023-08-29 17:27:57"
}
```

>After the request is sent, the SMS message will be automatically marked as Read if the `markAsRead` parameter is set to `true`.
>That means you won't be able to access it with another request or `Extract Latest SMS` step.
>
>If the `delete` parameter is set to `true`, the SMS will also be deleted.
>You can also read and delete SMS messages manually in the Team section from the <a class="endtest_link" href="https://app.endtest.io/settings">Settings</a> page.

An easier approach to extract the latest SMS is by using the `Extract Latest SMS` method from the Set Variable action, as described in the <a class="endtest_link" href="/advanced/read-sms/">Read SMS</a> chapter.

### 24. Remove All Spaces

The `removeAllSpaces` action can be used to remove all the spaces from a text.

| Key      | Value                                           |
|----------|-------------------------------------------------|
| action   | removeAllSpaces                                            |
| text | the text from which the spaces will be removed    |

### 25. Remove Pattern from Text

The `removePatternFromText` action can be used to remove a substring from a string.

Query Params that you need to add in the `Send API Request` modal:

| Key     | Value                                           |
|---------|-------------------------------------------------|
| action  | removePatternFromText                           |
| text    | the full text or the name of the variable       |
| pattern | the pattern of text that you want to remove     |

For example, let's say you have the following text:

```
57EUR
```

You can remove the `EUR` portion from that text by providing the following pattern:

```
EUR
```

The result will be the remaining text:

```
57
```
