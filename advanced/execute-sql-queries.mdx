## Introduction

You can easily connect to a database and execute SQL queries in your tests.

The following databases are supported by our platform:
* MySQL
* PostgreSQL
* Microsoft SQL
* Oracle SQL

To establish a new connection, select the `Connect to Database` option from the `Action` dropdown.

If you want to execute a SQL query without fetching the result, use the `Execute SQL Query` action.

If you want to get the result from a SQL query, use the `Extract result from SQL Query` option from the `Set Variable` action. This option allows you to fetch a value from a database and use it in your test.

## Steps

1. Add a `Connect to Database` step.<br />
2. Add the query in an `Execute SQL Query` or `Extract result from SQL Query` step.

Once the connection to the database is established with the `Connect to Database` step, you can continue to execute SQL queries until your test execution finishes.
