## Introduction

It's a best practice to reuse test cases.

For example, you can have only one Login test case and import it in all of your test suites.


## Guide

When you select the `Import Test Case` action, the `Test case to import` dropdown gets populated with the entire list of test cases that you have access to.

You can only import test cases from other Web Tests in a Web Test.

You can only import test cases from other Mobile Tests in a Mobile Test.

When the test is executed, the `Import Test Case` action executes the latest version of the imported test case.

The variables declared in the imported test case can be accessed from the test suite in which it gets imported.
