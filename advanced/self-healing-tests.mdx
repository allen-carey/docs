## Introduction

Endtest is using Machine Learning to help you with the maintenance of your tests.

By enabling the Machine Learning option, our platform will learn more about the elements and the flows from your application.

It will store up to 100 different locators for each element.

If a developer makes changes to your application, your tests will no longer be in sync with your application.

By using the Self-Healing functionality, our engine will detect the changes and use the spare locators.

That means you won't have to worry about constantly maintaining your tests.


## Steps
1. Go to the `Settings` screen for your test suite.
2. Enable the `Machine Learning` option from the `Advanced` tab.
3. Execute your test at least once, so our engine can store information about your elements.
4. Enable the `Self-Healing` option from the `Advanced` tab.
5. When you run the test, our engine can automatically use the spare locators if needed.
