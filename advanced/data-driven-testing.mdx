## Introduction

The `Import Test Case Multiple Times (CSV)` action allows you to execute the same test case multiple times in a row, while extracting data from a CSV file.

## Guide

When you select the `Import Test Case Multiple Times (CSV)` action, the `Test case to import` dropdown gets populated with the entire list of test cases that you have access to.

In order to get a `CSV File URL`, you can upload your CSV file in our <a class="endtest_link" href="https://app.endtest.io/drive">Drive</a> section.

For each row of the CSV file, a new set of variables will be created.

The name of the variables will be generated from the Column Headers of the CSV file, all spaces and non-alphanumeric characters will be removed and a `$` will be prepended to the name of the variable.

Here are some  examples:

```csv
| Column Header in CSV file | Generated Variable Name |
|---------------------------|-------------------------|
| email                     | $email                  |
| User Name                 | $UserName               |
| The_Address               | $TheAddress             |
| zip-code                  | $zipcode                |
```

The data from the rest of the CSV rows will not be altered in any way.

Let's suppose we have the following CSV file:

```csv
| email             | password           |
|-------------------|--------------------|
| jimmy@example.com | ^^VT[Nv20zSwCBh4*  |
| walter@random.com | ^]LNf]CHNQKOX(g*ld |
| jessica@inbox.com | ba!^tBJ            |
```

We can see that the CSV file has 2 column and 4 rows.

The Column Headers will be used only to name the variables.

The values for those variables will be extracted from the rest of the 3 rows.

If we would use this CSV file in our test with the `Import Test Case Multiple Times (CSV)` action, the imported test case would be executed 3 times, with 3 sets of variables, one set from each row.

You can only import test cases from other Web Tests in a Web Test.

You can only import test cases from other Mobile Tests in a Mobile Test.

When the test is executed, the `Import Test Case Multiple Times (CSV)` action executes the latest version of the imported test case.

The variables declared in the imported test case can be accessed from the test suite in which it gets imported.

<Tip> You can also extract data from Google Sheets by using the `Google Sheets API` and the <a class="endtest_link" href="/advanced/send-api-requests">Send API Request</a> action from Endtest. </Tip>
