## Introduction

Endtest can send you email notifications with the results of your test executions.

The settings must be configured for each test suite.

Only the users who have access to the test suite can receive the email notifications.

## Steps
1. Go to the `Settings` screen for your test suite.
2. Click on the `Notifications` tab.
3. Select one of the options from the `Email Notifications` dropdown:
    * Do not send
    * Send every time a test runs
    * Send only when a test fails

4. Click on the `Save` button.

<Tip> Each user can also edit the Email Notifications preference for their account from the <a class="endtest_link" href="https://app.endtest.io/settings">Settings</a> page. <br/><br/> This is useful in situations where you want to be added as a Collaborator in one or more test suites, but you don't want to get any emails with the results, even if the other Collaborators do want to get email notifications. </Tip>
