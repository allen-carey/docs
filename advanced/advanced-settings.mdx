## 1. Screenshot Tolerance (%)

This option is used to set the accuracy for the screenshot comparison operations.

For example, if you select 5%, your assertion will fail if the difference between the screenshots is more than 5%.

If the screenshots have different sizes, the larger one will be automatically resized to match the smaller one.

More details about this functionality are available in the <a class="endtest_link" href="/advanced/computer-vision/">Computer Vision</a> chapter.

## 2. Screenshot Fuzz (%)

This option is used to set the precision for the screenshot comparison operations.

A smaller value will lead to a more precise screenshot comparison.

A higher value will lead to a less precise screenshot comparison.

An optimal value for the Screenshot Fuzz (%) is somewhere between 2% and 20%, but you can select values between 1% and 50%.

More details about this functionality are available in the <a class="endtest_link" href="/advanced/computer-vision/">Computer Vision</a> chapter.

## 3. Page Load Timeout (s)

This defines the maximum amount of time that our engine will wait for a page to load.

If the page does not load within that time, an error will be thrown.

The setting also applies for AJAX requests sent by your application.

## 4. Element Load Timeout (s)

This defines the maximum amount of time that our engine will wait for an element to load.

If the element does not load within that time, an error will be thrown.

## 5. Automatic Timestamps

If set to `On every error or failure`, a timestamp will be added to the logs each time an error or failure is encountered.

If set to `On every step`, a timestamp will be added to the logs each time a step is executed.

If set to `Disabled`, no timestamps will be taken automatically.

## 6. Automatic Screenshots

If set to `On every error or failure`, a screenshot will be taken each time an error or failure is encountered.

If set to `On every step`, a screenshot will be taken each time a step is executed.

If set to `Disabled`, no screenshots will be taken automatically.

## 7. Error Handling

The option allows you to choose if the test will automatically stop when it encounters the first error or if it will continue.

## 8. Failed Assertion

The option allows you to choose if the test will automatically stop when it encounters the first failed assertion or if it will continue.

## 9. Machine Learning

If enabled, our engine will store information about the elements and the flows from your application.

By using the `Self-Healing` functionality, our engine can detect the changes and automatically update your tests.

<Note> Enabling this option slows down your test execution. </Note>

## 10. Self-Healing

If enabled, our engine will automatically update your test if any non-breaking changes are detected.

More details about this functionality are available in the <a class="endtest_link" href="/advanced/self-healing-tests">Self-Healing Tests</a> chapter.

<Note> Enabling this option slows down your test execution. </Note>

## 11. Video Recording

If enabled, a video recording for the test execution will be available in the <a class="endtest_link" href="https://app.endtest.io/results">Results</a> section.

## 12. Live Video

If enabled, a live video feed of the test execution will be shown in the <a class="endtest_link" href="https://app.endtest.io/results">Results</a> section.

<Note> Enabling this option slows down your test execution. </Note>

## 13. Edit Mode

This option relates to how you edit a step from a test.

If set to `Clean`, the values in the inputs from that step will be deleted when you change the locator type.

If set to `Smart`, the values in the inputs from that step will be kept when you change the locator type.

## 14. Add Chrome Extension

This option is available only for Web Tests.

You can add a `Chrome Extension` that will be loaded in the `Chrome` browser once the test execution starts.

Detailed instructions are provided in the <a class="endtest_link" href="/web-tests/how-to-test-chrome-extensions/">How to test Chrome Extensions</a> chapter.

<Note> The Chrome Extension is loaded only if the test is executed in Chrome. </Note>

## 15. Auto Grant Permissions

This option is available only for Mobile Tests.

If set to `True`, the permissions will be automatically granted to the mobile application.

If set to `False`, the permissions will not be automatically granted to the mobile application.

## 16. Alert Handling

This option is available for Web Tests and Mobile Tests.

If set to `Accept Alerts`, the alerts will be automatically accepted.

If set to `Dismiss Alerts`, the alerts will be automatically dismissed.

If set to `Ignore Alerts`, the alerts will be ignored and you can choose to add a `Close alert` step (for Web Tests) or a `Single Tap` (for Mobile Tests) step to accept or dismiss the alerts.

> Using the `Ignore Alerts` option for Web Tests may cause your test execution to get stuck or encounter errors, since the presence of an alert can affect the functionality of the test.
>
> You will need to use the `Close alert` option from the `Miscellaneous` action in order to accept and close those alerts.

## 17. Appium Version

This option is available only for Mobile Tests.

It allows you to select the Appium version for each test suite.

## 18. Geolocation

This option is available only for Web Tests.

It allows you to select the Geolocation type: HTML5 Geolocation or Real IP Geolocation.

You can also completely disable the Geolocation by selecting the None option.

## 19. Drag and Drop

This option is available only for Web Tests.

It allows you to select the technology used to perform a Drag and Drop: JavaScript or WebDriver.

## 20. Proxy IP

This option is available only for Web Tests.

It allows you to route the traffic from that test through the Proxy IP that you provide.

The Proxy IP that you provide needs to allow traffic from our list of Secure Gateway IP addresses.

## 21. No Reset

This option is available only for Mobile Tests.

If the option is set to Enabled, the app data will not be cleared if you close the app during a test execution.

In all situations, regardless of the No Reset option, the app data will be cleared once the test execution or the recording is finished.

## 22. Max Number of Errors

If a test execution reaches this number, it will automatically stop.

The default value is `10`.

The idea behind this setting is that a large number of errors in a test execution might signal that something unexpected happened, such as the environment being down.

Depending on the error type, the presence of each error might increase the duration of the test execution.

For example, an `Element not found` error means that the test already waited for a number of seconds for that element to be present, the number of seconds in that case being the actual `Element Load Timeout` value.

## 23. App Settings JSON

This option is available only for Mobile Tests.

The option enables you to update iOS app settings by using <a class="endtest_link" target="_blank" href="https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/UserDefaults/Preferences/Preferences.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/10000059i-CH6-SW5">iOS Settings bundle</a>.

The mobile device grid provider must also support this capability.

## 24. Show Step Names

If enabled, the `Step Names` will be printed in the test execution logs.

The number of the step will also be printed.
