## Introduction

You can manage the users and groups for your organization in the `Team` section from the <a class="endtest_link" href="https://app.endtest.io/settings">Settings</a> page.

## Users

Actions related to Users that you can perform in the `Team` section:
1. View the users from your team
2. Add an existing user to your team
3. Add a new user to your team
4. Remove a user from your team
5. Unblock a user
6. Accept changes in the name of the team

### 1. View the users from your team

Each user from your team is listed in the `Team Members` table.

If a user closes their account, that user will no longer be listed in that table.

### 2. Add an existing user to your team

If a user already signed up on  <a class="endtest_link" href="https://endtest.io">Endtest</a>, adding the user to your team will upgrade their account.

The user will receive an email notifying them that they have been added to your team.

> Adding an existing user to your team will not grant them access to your tests.
>
> In order to grant access to your tests, you will need to use the <a class="endtest_link" href="/advanced/adding-collaborators/">Collaborators</a> feature.

### 3. Add a new user to your team

If the user did not sign up on <a class="endtest_link" href="https://endtest.io">Endtest</a> yet, adding them to your team will also automatically create the account for them.

The user will receive an email notifying them that their account has been created and asking them to add a password to their account.

> Adding a new user to your team will not grant them access to your tests.
>
> In order to grant access to your tests, you will need to use the <a class="endtest_link" href="/advanced/adding-collaborators/">Collaborators</a> feature.

### 4. Remove a user from your team

If you are an Admin, you can remove a user from your team directly from the <a class="endtest_link" href="https://app.endtest.io/settings">Settings</a> page.

If a user who is not an Admin tries to remove a user from their team, they will get an error message.

You cannot remove yourself from the team, even if you are an Admin.

> In order to become an Admin for your organization, please write to our `Support Team`.

### 5. Unblock a user

If you are an Admin, you can unblock a team member directly from the <a class="endtest_link" href="https://app.endtest.io/settings">Settings</a> page.

A user account might get blocked if they run a number of tests in parallel which is greater than the number of parallel slots available for their team.

If a user is blocked, they won't be able to execute any tests or use the Endtest API.

A red lock icon will appear next to their name in the Team Members table.

To unblock that user, you just have to click on that red lock icon.

You cannot unblock your own account, even if you are an Admin.

> In order to become an Admin for your organization, please write to our `Support Team`.

### 6. Accept changes in the name of the team

In certain rare situations, you might see a Consent Modal.

Since our services are not targeted at consumers, but only to businesses or individual enterprises, a user is allowed to give consent and accept new policies in the name of their entire team.

> If you're getting a Consent Modal and you need more details, send us an email to `contact@endtest.io` and we'll provide answers to your questions.

## Groups

A group can contain multiple users and that makes <a class="endtest_link" href="https://app.endtest.io/guides/docs/adding-collaborators/">Collaboration</a> easier to manage.

1. View the groups from your team

4. Delete a label
