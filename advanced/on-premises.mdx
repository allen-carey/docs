## Details
    
<a class="endtest_link" href="https://endtest.io">Endtest</a> is a cloud solution.
    
We provide a secure and scalable cloud platform for testing web and mobile apps.
    
Our company has received the <a class="endtest_link" href="https://www.iso.org/isoiec-27001-information-security.html">ISO 27001</a> certification.
    
ISO 27001 is the international standard that is recognized globally for managing risks to the security of information you hold.
    
Endtest is also compliant with the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).
    
Despite these measures, some companies may still have requirements to store all the data on their own infrastructure.
    
For these situations, we provide the On-Premises version of Endtest which looks and works exactly like the standard cloud version, the main difference is that it's installed on the customer's infrastructure.
    
You can install the On-Premises version of Endtest on your own servers or on AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud.
    
With the On-Premises version, everything is stored on your side and anything can be customized according to your specific needs.
    
The cross-browser capabilities of the On-Premises version are directly related to the types of machines that you have.
    
For example, if you want your tests to also run on Internet Explorer 11, you will need to have Windows machines in your infrastructure.
    
And if you want your tests to also run on Safari, you will need to have macOS machines.
    
An alternative approach is to have a Hybrid option, where the Endtest platform and the database are hosted on your side, but the test execution machines are hosted on our side.
