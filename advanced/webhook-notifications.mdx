## Introduction

Endtest can send you notifications regarding your test executions to a Webhook URL that you provide.

The settings for Webhook Notifications must be configured for each test suite.

## Steps

1. Go to the `Settings` screen for your test suite.
2. Click on the `Notifications` tab.
3. Select one of the options from the `Webhook Notifications` dropdown:
   * Do not send
   * Send every time a test runs
   * Send only when a test fails
4. Add your `Webhook URL`.
5. Click on the `Save` button.

Endtest will send a POST request to your `Webhook URL` with the following parameters:
