## Introduction
    
You can use the same test suite for different environments (dev, staging, production, etc).
    
This can be achieved by using variables.
    
## Details
    
You can create a separate test case where you declare all or most of your variables.

<br />
    
Ideally, this test case should be the first test case in your test suite:

<br />
    
You can have separate test cases in which you declare the variables for each environment:

<br />
    
And when you execute the test suite, you can just select which test cases to execute:

<br />
    
Declaring your variables in a single test case also comes in handy if you want to use those variables in different test suites, you just have to use the `Import Test Case` action to fetch them:

<br />
    
In that situation, changing the environment can be done simply by editing that `Import Test Case` step and choosing a different test case that declares a different set of variables.
