## Introduction

You can easily integrate Endtest into your workflow by using our API.

These are the tasks you can perform with the Endtest API:
1. Start a test execution.
2. Start multiple test executions.
3. Fetch the results for a test execution.
4. Fetch the results for multiple test executions.
5. Stop a test execution.
6. Get the IDs and Names of all the test suites that you have access to.
7. Get the IDs, Names and External IDs of all the test cases from a test suite.
8. Upload a file in the [Drive Section](https://app.endtest.io/drive).
9. Get the list of files uploaded in the [Drive](https://app.endtest.io/drive).
10. Delete a file from the [Drive](https://app.endtest.io/drive).
11. Get the number of available parallel slots.

## 1. Start a test execution

To get the API request for executing a test, just click on `Get API Request` from the Run Test Suite modal.

The API request contains the `appId` and `appCode` which are used to identify your user and do not change.

This API request can only be called with an HTTP Method of type GET.

### Endtest API Parameters for starting a Web Test execution

| Endtest API Parameter   | Description                 |
|-------------------------|-----------------------------|
| action                  | The type of action (runWeb) |
| appId                   | The App ID of the user      |
| appCode                 | The App Code of the user    |
| suite                   | The ID of the test suite    |
| platform                | The platform to run the test on |
| os                      | The operating system for the execution |
| browser                 | The browser for the execution |
| browserVersion          | The browser version for the execution (latest or beta) |
| resolution              | The screen resolution for the execution |
| geolocation             | The Geolocation for the execution |
| cases                   | The test cases to be executed |
| notes                   | Notes that will appear in the execution |

### Endtest API Parameters for starting a Mobile Test execution

| Parameter | Description                               |
|-----------|-------------------------------------------|
| action    | The type of action (runMobile)            |
| appId     | The App ID of the user                    |
| appCode   | The App Code of the user                  |
| suite     | The ID of the test suite                  |
| platform  | The platform to run the test on           |
| device    | The mobile device to run the test on      |
| app       | The download link for the APK or IPA file |
| grid      | The mobile device grid provider           |
| cases     | The test cases to be executed             |
| notes     | Notes that will appear in the execution   |


The response from this API request contains a `hash` which can be used to uniquely identify that test execution.

### Declaring variables in the Endtest API request

You can add variables directly in the Endtest API request.

For example, adding `&username=Matt` will automatically create the variable `$username` with the value `Matt`.

### Overwriting the settings for Webhook Notifications

The Webhook URL and Webhook Notifications can be overwritten by adding `&webhookUrl=your_webhook_url` and `&webhookNotifications=option`, where option can be 0, 1 or 2.

0 = Do not send<br />
1 = Send every time a test runs<br />
2 = Send only when a test fails<br />

If your Webhook URL is `https://my-own-webhook.com` and you want to receive notifications every time a test is executed, you would need to add the following to your Endtest API call:<br />
`&webhookUrl=https://my-own-webhook.com&webhookNotifications=1`

### Partial match for the app parameter for Mobile Tests

The 'app' parameter for starting Mobile Tests can be a partial match.

For example, if we have this download link for an APK file:

`https://endtest-files.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/uzikStbflpt3PcQiM8z8ByYh1H/Master-Sample.apk`

The app parameter can look like this:

`&app="[*Master*.apk]"`

>- Double quotes should be added at the beginning and end of that value.
>- Square brackets should be added at the beginning and end, inside the double quotes.
>- The asterisk is a wildcard, can be placed wherever you want to replace 0 or more characters.
>- It will fetch the most recent uploaded file from the Endtest Drive that matches that pattern.
>- The pattern is not case-sensitive.
>- The `Visibility` property of the file from the Endtest Drive must be set to `MyEntireTeam`.

<Note> **Legacy Endtest API requests** <br /> <br /> The Endtest API request for starting test executions was updated on October 12 2021. The legacy Endtest API requests are still supported. <br /> <br /> You can download the legacy Endtest API Mappings for starting a web test execution here: [Endtest_API_Mappings_for_Web_Tests.pdf](https://endtest-files.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/6Z0PMGM06Y4iXYctL2KxExoB2KgGjP/Endtest_API_Mappings_for_Web_Tests.pdf) </Note>

## 2. Start multiple test executions

The only way to start multiple test executions with one single Endtest API request is by using <a class="endtest_link" href="/advanced/team/#labels">Labels</a>.

In the Endtest API request, replace the `suite` parameter with the `label` parameter and provide the name of the label instead of the test suite ID.


This API request can only be called with an HTTP Method of type GET.

### Endtest API Parameters for starting multiple Web Test executions

>The value from the `label` parameter is case-sensitive.
>
>Only one Label Name can be provided in the `label` parameter for each request.
>
>Only one configuration can be provided in each request.

## 3. Fetch the results for a test execution

To get the results from a test execution with our API, use a GET request with the following format:

`https://app.endtest.io/api.php?action=getResults&appId=[your app id]&appCode=[your app code]&hash=[the returned hash]&format=[html or json or json-light]`

Replace `[your app id]` and `[your app code]` with your `appId` and `appCode` values, which you can retrieve from the <a class="endtest_link" href="https://app.endtest.io/settings">Settings</a> page by clicking on the `Show API Credentials` button.

Replace `[the returned hash]` with the hash that was returned by the Endtest API request for starting a test execution.

You have the option to choose a format, either `html` or `json` or `json-light`.

This API request can only be called with an HTTP Method of type GET.

| Endtest API Parameter | Description                                     |
|-----------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| action                | The type of action (getResults)                |
| appId                 | The App ID of the user                          |
| appCode               | The App Code of the user                        |
| hash                  | The unique hash for that test execution         |
| format                | The format of the results (json, json-light or html) |

If you're planning to integrate Endtest into your continuous delivery workflow, you're going to need to use both the API request for starting a test execution and the API request for fetching the results.

Because it takes time for a functional test to finish, you either need to add a `sleep` in your script or a loop that calls the API request for fetching the results at a certain interval until the test execution is finished.

Here is a sample Shell script that shows you how to do that:

```
#!/bin/bash
hash=$(curl -X GET --header "Accept: */*" "${3}")
for run in {1.."${4}"}
do
  sleep 30
  result=$(curl -X GET --header "Accept: */*" "https://app.endtest.io/api.php?action=getResults&appId=${1}&appCode=${2}&hash=${hash}&format=json")
  if [ "$result" == "Test is still running." ]
  then
    status=$result
    # Don't print anything
  elif [ "$result" == "Processing video recording." ]
  then
    status=$result
    # Don't print anything
  elif [ "$result" == "Stopping." ]
  then
    status=$result
  elif [ "$result" == "Erred." ]
  then
    status=$result
    echo $status
  elif [ "$result" == "" ]
  then
    status=$result
    # Don't print anything
  else
     echo "$result" | jq
     exit 0
  fi
done
exit
```

This sample script would require the following arguments:
1. The `App ID` for your account.
2. The `App Code` for your account.
3. The API Request for starting the test execution.
4. The number of times the API request for fetching the results will be sent once every 30 seconds.

For example, if you know that your test execution usually takes 3 minutes, you should use the value 7.

`7 x 30 seconds = 210 seconds > 3 minutes`

Don't forget to make your Shell script executable by running the following command:

```console
sudo chmod +x test.sh
```

And you would also need to install the `jq` package:

```sh
sudo apt-get install jq
```

The command for running the sample Shell script would have the following format:

```sh
./test.sh app-id app-code api-request-to-start-test-execution number-of-loops
```

Let's pretend we have the following values:

```
App ID = 44233559

App Code = 22381137

Endtest API Request to start test execution = "https://app.endtest.io/api.php?action=runTestSuite&appId=44233559&appCode=22381137&testSuite=106877&selectedPlatform=windows&selectedOs=a&selectedBrowser=chrome&selectedResolution=d&selectedLocation=sanfrancisco&selectedCases=all&writtenAdditionalNotes="

Number of loops = 10
```

The command for running the sample Shell script would look like this:

```sh
./test.sh 44233559 22381137 "https://app.endtest.io/api.php?action=runTestSuite&appId=44233559&appCode=22381137&testSuite=106877&selectedPlatform=windows&selectedOs=a&selectedBrowser=chrome&selectedResolution=d&selectedLocation=sanfrancisco&selectedCases=all&writtenAdditionalNotes=" 10
```

The sample script will output the Results in JSON format with the following keys:
* `test_suite_name` (string) - The name of the test suite.
* `configuration` (string) - The configuration of the machine or mobile device on which the test was executed.
* `test_cases` (int32) - The number of test cases.
* `passed` (int32) - The number of assertions that have passed.
* `failed` (int32) - The number of assertions that have failed.
* `errors` (int32) - The number of errors that have been encountered.
* `start_time` (int32) - The timestamp for the start of the test execution.
* `end_time` (int32) - The timestamp for the end of the test execution.
* `detailed_logs` (int32) - The detailed logs for the test execution.
* `screenshots_and_video` (int32) - The URL for the screenshots and the video recording of the test execution.
* `test_case_management` (int32) - The ID, Name, Status and External IDs for each Test Case.

<Note> Using the `json-light` format instead of `json` means that the Results in JSON format won't include the `detailed_logs` and `screenshots_and_video` items. </Note>



You can also use the value of the `hash` variable to generate the link to the Results page for that test execution:

```sh
results=https://app.endtest.io/results?hash="$hash"
```


>An alternative way to retrieve the results from a test execution is to add your Webhook URL in the [Webhook Notifications](/advanced/webhook-notifications) settings or in the Endtest API request for starting a test execution.
>
>After the test execution is finished, the results will be automatically sent to that Webhook URL.

## 4. Fetch the results for multiple test executions

The exact same Endtest API request can be used, the only difference is that you can provide multiple unique hashes, separated by commas.

This API request can only be called with an HTTP Method of type GET.

| Endtest API Parameter   | Description                 |
|-------------|-----------------------------------------|
| action      | The type of action (getResults)        |
| appId       | The App ID of the user                  |
| appCode     | The App Code of the user                |
| hash     | List of unique hashes, separated by commas    |
| format    | The format of the results (json or html)        |

>You can also fetch all the test executions by using the `getAllResults` action, which requires the following parameters: `appId`, `appCode`, `format`.


## 5. Stop a test execution

To stop a test execution with the Endtest API, use the following command:

`https://app.endtest.io/api.php?action=stopTest&appId=[your app id]&appCode=[your app code]&hash=[the returned hash]`

Replace `[your app id]` and `[your app code]` with your `appId` and `appCode` values, which you can retrieve from the <a class="endtest_link" href="https://app.endtest.io/settings">Settings</a> page by clicking on the `Show API Credentials` button.

Replace `[the returned hash]` with the hash that was returned by the Endtest API request for starting a test execution.

This API request can only be called with an HTTP Method of type GET.

>You can also stop a test execution directly from the UI, by clicking on the `Stop Test` button from the Results page.
>
>You can also use the `Stop Test` option from the `Miscellaneous` action in your test. The test will automatically stop when it reaches that step.
>

>
>The purpose of this request is only to restore a previously exported test suite.
>
>It should not be used to share a test suite with your team, since it's easier to do that by using the [Collaborators](/advanced/adding-collaborators) feature.
>
