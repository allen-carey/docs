## Introduction

Since your tests are stored in our cloud, you can easily grant access to other users or groups.

Access must be granted for each test suite to each user or each group.


## Steps
1. Click on the `Settings` button for your test suite.
2. Click on the `Collaborators` tab.
3. Click on the `Add Collaborator` button.
4. Select the User or Group to which you want to grant access.
5. Select the Role for that User or Group.
6. Click on the `Add` button.

If you have the Owner role, you can revoke access by clicking on the `X` button next to a user.

That role also allows you change the role of other users and groups in that test suite.

## Collaborators FAQ

#### 1. Why is the `Users` dropdown empty?

The `Users` dropdown is populated with the users from your `Team`.

If the `Users` dropdown is empty, it either means that you do not have other users in your team or every user in your team has already been added as a Collaborator.

#### 2. How do I add `users` in my team?

If you are a Team Admin, you can add users in your in the Team section from the <a class="endtest_link" href="https://app.endtest.io/settings">Settings</a> page.

More details about adding users in your team are available in the <a class="endtest_link" href="https://app.endtest.io/guides/docs/team/">Team</a> chapter.

#### 3. Why is the `Groups` dropdown empty?

The `Groups` dropdown is populated with the groups from your `Team`.

If the `Groups` dropdown is empty, it either means that you do not have groups in your team or every group in your team has already been added as a Collaborator.

#### 4. How do I add `groups`?

If you are a Team Admin, you can create groups in the Team section from the <a class="endtest_link" href="https://app.endtest.io/settings">Settings</a> page.

More details about creating groups in your team are available in the <a class="endtest_link" href="https://app.endtest.io/guides/docs/team/">Team</a> chapter.

#### 5. What happens if a `user` is added as a `Viewer` but that `user` is also part of a `group` which is added as an `Owner` or `Editor`?

In all situations where a `user` has access to a test through different roles, the highest role will override the other roles.

In this case, the `user` will have `Owner` permissions, since the `user` is part of a group which is added with the `Owner` role.

#### 6. Can I remove myself or my `group` from the `Collaborators` list for a test suite?

No, you cannot remove yourself from the `Collaborators` list, even if you have the `Owner` role.

The only solution in this situation is to be removed by another `Owner`.

If you are part of a `group`, you cannot remove that `group` from the `Collaborators` list.
