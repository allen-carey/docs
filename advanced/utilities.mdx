## Introduction

In certain scenarios, you might need to process data.

For example, you might need to automatically extract a number from a text.

The `Utilities` option is available in the `Miscellaneous` action.

## Steps

1. Add a new step in your test.
2. Select the `Miscellaneous` action from the `Action` dropdown.
3. Select the `Utilities` option from the `Action Type` dropdown.
4. Select the method that you want to use from the `Method` dropdown.

## Methods

You can choose from different methods:

### 1. Extract Text After Pattern

The `Extract Text After Pattern` method can be used to extract a substring from a string, by providing another substring as a pattern.

**Query Params that you need to add in the `Send API Request` modal:**

For example, let's say you have the following text:

```
1234 is your validation code
```

You can extract the `1234` portion of that text by providing the following pattern:

```
is your validation code
```

That will extract the following substring:

```
1234
```


### 3. Extract Numbers From Text

The `Extract Numbers From Text` method can used to extract all the numbers from a string.


For example, let's say you have the following text:

```
Your validation code is 1234. Do not share it with anyone else.
```

You can extract the `1234` portion of that text because it's entirely made up of numbers.


### 4. Extract Value From JSON

The `Extract Value From JSON` method can used to get a value from a JSON object.

For example, if you have the following JSON object:

```javascript
{"firstName":"John", "lastName":"Doe"}
```

Don't forget, you can also use Endtest variables in all these methods.

### 5. Extract Item From Array

The `Extract Item From Array` method can used to get an item from an array.

For example, if you have the following array:

```javascript
["apple", "orange", "tomato"]
```

You can chain together multiple `Utilities` steps which can use the `Extract Item From Array` and `Extract Value From JSON` methods to extract values from complex JSON objects.


For example, you might have a complex JSON object like this:

```javascript
{
"employees":[
    {"firstName":"John", "lastName":"Doe"},
    {"firstName":"Anna", "lastName":"Smith"},
    {"firstName":"Peter", "lastName":"Jones"}
]
}
```
If you want to extract the second `firstName` value from that JSON object, you have to chain together 3 `Utilities` steps:  

Start by using the `Extract Value From JSON` method to get the value for the `employees` item:

```javascript
[
    {"firstName":"John", "lastName":"Doe"},
    {"firstName":"Anna", "lastName":"Smith"},
    {"firstName":"Peter", "lastName":"Jones"}
]
```

That value will be an array and you can use the `Extract Item From Array` to get the second item from that array.

```javascript
{"firstName":"Anna", "lastName":"Smith"}
```

That item will be a JSON object and you can once again use the `Extract Value From JSON` method to get the value for the `firstName`.


### 6. Extract Last Item From Array

The `Extract Last Item From Array` method can used to get the last item from an array.


### 7. Get Text Length

The `Get Text Length` method can used to get the character count of a text.

### 8. Store Item in Vault

In some scenarios, you might need to manage values across different test suites.

These use cases can usually be handled by using <a class="endtest_link" href="/advanced/how-to-use-variables/">Variables</a> and <a class="endtest_link" href="/advanced/importing-test-cases/">Import Test Case</a> actions.

But there are other scenarios where one test suite might update a value which is used by other test suites.

You can use the `Endtest Vault` to store and fetch global values, which can be accessed from all your test suites.

It works like a permanent storage.

And these global values are called `items`.

The `Store Item in Vault` method can be used to store an item.

The `items` stored in the `Endtest Vault` can only be accessed by you and your Team.

The method requires entering the <a class="endtest_link" href="/advanced/how-to-use-the-endtest-api/">Endtest API</a> credentials (`App ID` and `App Code`), which you can find in the <a class="endtest_link" href="https://app.endtest.io/settings">Settings</a> page.

### 9. Get Item from Vault

The `Get Item from Vault` method can be used to fetch global values stored in the `Endtest Vault`.

These global values are called `items`.

The `items` stored in the `Endtest Vault` can only be accessed by you and your Team.

The method requires entering the <a class="endtest_link" href="/advanced/how-to-use-the-endtest-api/">Endtest API</a> credentials (`App ID` and `App Code`), which you can find in the <a class="endtest_link" href="https://app.endtest.io/settings">Settings</a> page.

When the `item` is fetched from the `Endtest Vault`, the value of that `item` will be extracted into a variable.

The value will also be displayed in the Logs of the Results page for that test execution.

If you do not want the value to be displayed in the Logs, you'll need to give the `item` a name that contains one of these 2 strings: `secret` or `password` (uppercase or lowercase or mixed). That can only be done when using the `Store Item in Vault` method.


### 10. Generate Random Name

The `Generate Random Name` method can be used to generate random names.


### 11. Extract Character from String

The `Extract Character from String` method can be used to extract a certain character from a string.


### 12. Convert Text to LowerCase

The `Convert Text to LowerCase` method can be used to convert a text to LowerCase.


### 13. Convert Text to UpperCase

The `Convert Text to UpperCase` method can be used to convert a text to UpperCase.

### 14. Capitalize Text

The `Capitalize Text` method can be used to capitalize a text, converting the first letter of each word to a capital letter (uppercase letter) and the remaining letters to lower case.


### 15. Send Email

The `Send Email` method can be used to send an email from any `endtest-mail.io` address.

This feature is not available during the free trial.

>If you want to also add an attachment to the email, use the <a class="endtest_link" href="/advanced/utilities-api/#14-send-email/">Utilities API</a> instead.


### 16. Math Calculations

The `Math Calculations` method can be used to perform mathematical operations.

>Supported operations: Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division, Round, Round Down, Round Up.
>
>You can perform math operations with variables by placing the variable name between double curly brackets:
>
>```{{$price}};{{$tax}}```


### 17. Remove Newline Characters

The `Remove Newline Characters` method can be used to remove Newline characters.

### 18. Trim String

The `Trim String` method removes any leading and trailing whitespaces including tabs.

### 19. Extract Random Item From List

The `Extract Random Item From List` method can used to get a random item from a list.

### 20. Extract Value From XML

The `Extract Value From XML` method can used to get a value from an XML object.

### 21. Remove Pattern from String

The `Remove Pattern from String` method can used to remove a substring from a string.

### 22. Get Array Length

The `Get Array Length` method can used to get the number of items from an array.

<Note> Don't forget, you can also use Endtest variables in all the Utilities methods. </Note>
