## Introduction

It's considered a best practice to use variables in your tests.

This helps you avoid situations where you need to update the same value in multiple places.

## Declaring variables

You can use the `Set Variable` action to declare a new variable.

The options from the `Set Variable` action allow you to enter, extract or even generate values.

All variable names must start with the `$` character.

Once declared, a variable can be used across the entire test suite.

If you want to use it in other test suites, you have to import the test case in which the variable was declared.

<Note> The Variable Types which involve randomness have mandatory inputs for rules which control that randomness. For example, the `Random Number` option requires users to declare a value for the `Length of Number`. And the `Random Email` option requires users to declare a value for the `Email Domain`. </Note>

<Note> The `Real Phone Number` and `Extract Latest SMS` options require your account to be associated with real phone numbers. We provide real phone numbers for our users. You don't have to use any external service. If there are no real phone numbers associated with your account, please contact our Support Team. More information is available in the [Read SMS](/advanced/read-sms) chapter. </Note>

You can also declare variables directly in the Endtest API request for starting a test execution, more details are available in the [Endtest API](/advanced/how-to-use-the-endtest-api) chapter.

## Using variables

After you set a variable, you can use it in other steps or cases by simply entering its name in any input.

Simply typing `$` inside an input will display a dropdown with the available variables.

You can concatenate variables with strings or with other variables by placing the variable name between double curly brackets: <br/>
`My name is {{$username}} and my email is {{$email}}`

You can also print the variables in the Results by using the `Variable` or `All Variables` options from the `Print in Results` action.

## System variables

System variables are automatically created in each test execution.

They can be used in `If Statements` or other steps.

## Transfer variables to JavaScript

You can even transfer a variable to JavaScript, by using the `Transfer to JavaScript` action.

After that, you can perform different operations with that variable in JavaScript with an `Execute JavaScript` step.

If you want to transfer a variable from JavaScript, you need to use the `Extract value from JavaScript Variable` option from the `Set Variable` action.

<Note> You can find more details about the `Execute JavaScript` action in the [Execute JavaScript](/web-tests/execute-javascript) chapter. </Note>
