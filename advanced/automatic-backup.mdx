## Introduction

Endtest can automatically backup your tests.

You can configure the Automatic Backup preferences for each test suite individually.

## Details

The following options can be configured:
* Frequency
* Retention Period

All your backups will be listed in the <a class="endtest_link" href="https://app.endtest.io/backups">Backups</a> section from Endtest.

You can easily restore a test from a backup with the click of a button.

You can also manually create a backup by simply clicking on the `Backup` button next to your test suite.
