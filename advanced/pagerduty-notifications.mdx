## Introduction
    
Endtest can send you PagerDuty notifications (also known as Alerts) when you have an error or a failed assertion in a test execution.
    
The settings can be configured for each test suite.
    
    
## Steps
1. Go to the `Settings` screen for your test suite.
2. Click on the `Notifications` tab.
3. Select one of the options from the `PagerDuty Alerts` dropdown:
   * Do not send
   * Send only when a test fails
4. Select the PagerDuty service.
5. Click on the `Save` button.

<Note> Make sure to integrate Endtest with your PagerDuty services by following the instructions from the <a class="endtest_link" href="/integrations/pagerduty">PagerDuty</a> chapter. <br /> <br /> If you are not getting the alerts on PagerDuty, you should check if you're on the same Endtest Team with the user who made the connection to the PagerDuty service.  </Note>
