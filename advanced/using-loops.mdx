## Introduction

The `Import Test Case Multiple Times` action allows you to execute the same test case multiple times in a row.

## Guide

When you select the `Import Test Case Multiple Times` action, the `Test case to import` dropdown gets populated with the entire list of test cases that you have access to.

A value for the `Number of iterations` must be provided.

The number of the current iteration can be fetched during the test execution with the `$systemCurrentLoopIteration` system variable.

You can only import test cases from other Web Tests in a Web Test.

You can only import test cases from other Mobile Tests in a Mobile Test.

When the test is executed, the `Import Test Case Multiple Times` action executes the latest version of the imported test case.

The variables declared in the imported test case can be accessed from the test suite in which it gets imported.
