## Introduction

An If Statement is a conditional statement that, if proved true, performs a number of steps.

There are certain scenarios where we need to execute some steps only if a certain condition is met.

IF Statements can be nested in other IF Statements.

An IF Statement can cross the boundary of a test case and continue into the next test case.

## If Statements

IF Statements can be added by using the `Start If Statement` action.

In order to close an IF Statement, we need to use the `End If Statement` action.

You can choose from the following types of IF Statements:

## Else Statements

You can also use Else Statements, with the `Start Else Statement` and `End Else Statement` actions.

An Else Statement is an alternative statement that is executed if the result of a previous If Statement evaluates to false.
