## Introduction

In a Web Test, you can add steps to verify file downloads.

After you trigger a file download, you can extract information about the file in variables.  
Then, you can use those variables in other steps, such as [Assertions](/web-tests/assertions-for-web-tests) and [If Statements](/web-tests/if-statements-for-web-tests).

## Details

You can extract information about a downloaded file by using these methods from the [Set Variable](/advanced/how-to-use-variables) action:

1. `Extract Name of Most Recent Downloaded File`
2. `Extract Size of Most Recent Downloaded File`
3. `Extract MIME Type of Most Recent Downloaded File`

<Note> **Waiting for a download to complete**  
Endtest will automatically wait for a download to complete when using one of those methods.  
There is no need to add a [Pause](/advanced/waits/#3-pause) step, unless the download takes more than 120 seconds, which is the default download timeout. </Note>

After youâ€™ve extracted the information into variables, you can verify the values from those variables by using the `Variable Assertion` method from the `Add Assertion` action.

You can also clear the Downloads directory by using the `Clear Downloads Directory` method from the `Miscellaneous` action.

<Note> **Browser Support**  
File downloads can be tested in Chrome, Edge, Firefox, and mobile browsers.  
File downloads cannot be tested in Safari and Internet Explorer 11. </Note>
