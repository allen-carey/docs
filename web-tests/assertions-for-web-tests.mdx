## Introduction

We need assertions in order to know if our test execution was successful or not.

If we do not add assertions in our test cases, the values for `Passed` and `Failed` will be zero.

A test case can have more than one assertion.

## Solution

Assertions can be added by using the `Add Assertion` action.

You can choose from the following types of assertions:

| Assertion Type                     | Description                                                                         |
