## Introduction

There are 2 ways to create Web Tests:
1. With the [Endtest Chrome Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/endtest/jbdgfkeimppmnfemmgfafiomihlibdfa).
2. Manually adding test suites, test cases and steps.

## 1. With the Endtest Chrome Extension.

The extension allows you to record Web Tests directly in your Chrome browser.

Those tests are saved directly into your Endtest account.

You can download and install the [Endtest Chrome Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/endtest/jbdgfkeimppmnfemmgfafiomihlibdfa) from the Chrome Web Store.

It can identify elements by ID, Name, CSS Selector and XPath.

The extension can also handle complex scenarios, with full support for iframes and multiple tabs.

You can also add steps for assertions and screenshots.

The recording can be paused and resumed.

Settings are also available and can be updated even while recording.

After a test has been saved, you can manually make changes to that test.

## 2. Manually adding test suites, test cases and steps.

### Add a test suite

1. Go to the [Web Tests](https://app.endtest.io/tests) section.
2. Click on the `Add Test Suite` button.
3. Enter the name for the test suite.
4. Click on the `Save Test Suite` button.

### Add a test case

Test cases can be added only after you have created the test suite.

1. Click on the `Add Test Case` button.
2. Enter the name for the test case.

### Add steps inside the test case

A test case is made up of steps.

To add a new step, just click on the `Add Step` button.

Every step is defined by its Action.

Some actions are tied to the entire page (actions such as `Go to URL`, `Refresh Page`, `Take Screenshot`, etc).

While other actions must be tied to a specific element (actions such as `Click`, `Write Text`, etc).

To tie an Action to a specific Element, you must use a Locator.

A Locator is basically an attribute which identifies the element (Id, Name, XPath, Link Text, etc).
