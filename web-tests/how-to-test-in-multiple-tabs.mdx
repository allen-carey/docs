## Introduction

There are scenarios where you might need to interact with multiple browser tabs in a test.

Any modern testing tool should support testing in multiple browser tabs.

And Endtest is no exception.

## Interact with an element that is in a different browser tab

When a new browser tab gets opened, the test will not switch the focus automatically.

Since the element is in a separate browser tab, we have to tell the test to switch the focus to that browser tab before interacting with the element.

In the `Miscellaneous` action, you have the following methods:

- `Switch to next tab`
- `Switch to previous tab`

Use `Switch to next tab` when you need to switch focus to the next tab.

When you're done interacting with the elements from that browser tab, you can use `Switch to previous tab` to switch the focus back to the original browser tab.

## Opening a new tab

You may encounter scenarios where you need to open a new browser tab.

For example, in a Sign Up test, you might need to fetch the activation code from the [Endtest Mailbox](/web-tests/docs/how-to-test-emails) in a different browser tab.

You can use the `Open new tab` method from the `Miscellaneous` action.

When using that action, the test will automatically switch focus to the new tab.

Or you can add an [Execute JavaScript](/web-tests/execute-javascript) step, with the following JavaScript code:

```javascript
window.open('');
```

And you can even provide the URL directly in the JavaScript code:

```javascript
window.open('https://app.endtest.io/mailbox?email={{$email}}');
```

When using JavaScript to open a new tab, the test will not automatically switch focus to that new tab.

That's why you need to add a `Switch to next tab` step after that.

## Closing a tab

Normally, you don't have to close browser tabs in a test.

The browser tabs get closed automatically when the test execution is finished.

But if you have a scenario where you need to do that, you can use the `Close tab` method from the `Miscellaneous` action.

When using that action, the test will automatically switch focus to the previous tab.

<Warning>The `Switch to next tab` and `Switch to previous tab` actions are using the `switch_to_window` method from Selenium WebDriver. You should never remove the `target="_blank"` attribute from link elements during your test. That is a bad practice, since it modifies the web application that's being tested. We strongly advise against using that method. </Warning>
