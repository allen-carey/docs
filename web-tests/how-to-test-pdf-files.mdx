## Introduction

In some cases, you may want access to those PDF files during your tests to check their contents.

You can test PDF documents with our platform.

## Solution

There are 2 scenarios:

1. **You have the link to the PDF file.**  
   All you need to do is access that link with a `Go to URL` step:  
   <img src="https://app.endtest.io/images/goToUrlPdf.png" alt="endtest pdf" height="100"/>

2. **You have a button to download the PDF.**  
   Downloading the PDF will actually open it in a new browser tab.  
   Add a `Switch to next tab` step to change the focus to that tab.

<br />

In both cases, if you need to scroll down, use the `Press Key` action:  
<img src="https://app.endtest.io/images/docScrollPdf.png" alt="endtest pdf" height="100"/>

You can also jump to a certain page by appending the page number at the end of the URL of the PDF file.

For example, if you want to jump to page 3, you will need to add `#page=3`.
