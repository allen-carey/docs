## Introduction
    
The `Start Web Crawler` action allows you to check all the pages of your web application.
    
## Solution
    
All you have to do is provide a URL, and our Web Crawler will access it, automatically fetch all the hyperlinks, visit each one, and retrieve the page load time and a screenshot for each.
    
If something goes wrong and a page doesn't load, you'll see the error and the details in the **Results** for that test execution.

<Info> The number of hyperlinks that our Web Crawler will visit is limited by default. If you want to remove that limit for your account, please send us a message. </Info>
