## Introduction

You can execute your Web Tests directly on our cross-browser cloud infrastructure.

We provide real browsers on Windows and macOS machines.

You get to test your Web Applications on relevant environments, not on headless browsers on Linux machines.

Browsers on Windows machines:
- Google Chrome
- Mozilla Firefox
- Internet Explorer 10
- Internet Explorer 11
- Microsoft Edge

Browsers on macOS machines:
- Google Chrome
- Mozilla Firefox
- Safari
- Microsoft Edge

We also provide a list of mobile devices on which you can execute your Web Tests.

## Steps:

1. Go to the [Web Tests](https://app.endtest.io/tests) section.
2. Click on the `Run` button next to a test suite.
3. Select the desired configuration.
4. Start the test execution.
5. You will be automatically redirected to the [Results](https://app.endtest.io/results) section.
