## Introduction

Some frameworks will generate elements with dynamic locators, meaning they might have a different ID with each rendering of the page.

For example, a button might have the ID `register_325629` and then `register_861951` after the page reloads.

## Solutions

### 1. Change the Settings for the Endtest Chrome Extension

The [Endtest Chrome Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/endtest/jbdgfkeimppmnfemmgfafiomihlibdfa) includes a `Settings` section that lets you configure it to ignore the `ID` attribute.

<img

  alt="endtest chrome extension settings"
  height="550"
/>

You can update those settings even after the recording has started.

If your elements have custom data attributes, you can take advantage of them by adding the names of those attributes to the **Custom data attributes** field in the `Settings` section.

### 2. Write a custom XPath

The element might have a certain attribute with a value that doesn't change over time.

You can write an XPath that locates the element using that attribute, for example:
```xpath
//*[@attribute="attribute_value"]
```

You can also write an XPath that locates the element by using only part of the value of the attribute:
```xpath
//*[contains(@attribute, "part_of_attribute_value")]
```

And you can write an XPath that uses multiple attributes:
```xpath
//*[@attribute_1="attribute_value_1" and @attribute_2="attribute_value_2"]
```

### 3. Write a custom CSS Selector

The element might have a certain attribute that has a certain value that doesn't change over time.

You can write a CSS Selector which locates the element by using that attribute, like this:

`[attribute='attribute_value']`

But what if we actually need to find out what that ID is?

In order to tackle this situation, we have to use the `Execute JavaScript` action and locate the element by using one its attributes.

If the element has the `title` attribute with the value `Register`, we need to run the following JavaScript code with the `Execute JavaScript` action:

```javascript
theId = document.querySelector("*[title='Register']").getAttribute("id");
```
After that, we can just transfer the value from that JavaScript variable to an Endtest variable with the `Extract Value from JS Variable` option from the `Set Variable` action.
